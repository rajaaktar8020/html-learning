This assignment was generated with the help of ChatGPT, but I completed it using my previous learnin 
and understanding. After submitting my code, I scored 9 out of 10. Later, 
I fixed a few minor mistakes such as proper spacing, spelling errors, and 
removed unnecessary lines to improve the overall quality of the work.

(same size as the previous section heading)

Now I have decided to follow one clear path with daily focus and patience.
This time my goal is to move slowly but strongly and build my foundation step by step. (STRONGLY EMPHASIZED)
